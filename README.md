# 🗣️ Translator Web App using Google Translation API

The web app uses the **Google Translation API** to translate from the source text in an given *source* language to text in the *target* language which is the language you want to **translate** your original or *source* text to.


# 🛠️ Installation and Setup

1. First you need to clone the repo and there is no change needed for the html and js files.
2. For backend, first setup the *Node JS* backend using this command - 
``` console
npm init -y
```
3. Then just install the dependencies of the backend API using this command - 
``` console
npm install
```
4 . Hey now you are good to go, you might need to change the backend API URL in the script js file if you change your port number or something else it's done.👍
